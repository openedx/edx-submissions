"""
Submission models hold student responses to problems, scores, and a history of
those scores. It is intended to be a general purpose store that is usable by
different problem types, and is therefore ignorant of ORA workflow.

NOTE: We've switched to migrations, so if you make any edits to this file, you
need to then generate a matching migration for it using:

    ./manage.py makemigrations submissions
