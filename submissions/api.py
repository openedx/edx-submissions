    """Creates a submission for assessment.

    Generic means by which to submit an answer for assessment.

    Args:
        student_item_dict (dict): The student_item this
            submission is associated with. This is used to determine which
            course, student, and location this submission belongs to.

        answer (JSON-serializable): The answer given by the student to be assessed.

        submitted_at (datetime): The date in which this submission was submitted.
            If not specified, defaults to the current date.

        attempt_number (int): A student may be able to submit multiple attempts
            per question. This allows the designated attempt to be overridden.
            If the attempt is not specified, it will take the most recent
            submission, as specified by the submitted_at time, and use its
            attempt_number plus one.

    Returns:
        dict: A representation of the created Submission. The submission
        contains five attributes: student_item, attempt_number, submitted_at,
        created_at, and answer. 'student_item' is the ID of the related student
        item for the submission. 'attempt_number' is the attempt this submission
        represents for this question. 'submitted_at' represents the time this
        submission was submitted, which can be configured, versus the
        'created_at' date, which is when the submission is first created.

    Raises:
        SubmissionRequestError: Raised when there are validation errors for the
            student item or submission. This can be caused by the student item
            missing required values, the submission being too long, the
            attempt_number is negative, or the given submitted_at time is invalid.
        SubmissionInternalError: Raised when submission access causes an
            internal error.

    Examples:

        >>>    student_id="Tim",
