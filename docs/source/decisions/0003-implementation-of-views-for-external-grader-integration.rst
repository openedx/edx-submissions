3. Implementation of XQueue Compatible Views for External Grader Integration
############################################################################

Status

**Provisional** *2025-02-21*

Implemented by https://github.com/openedx/edx-submissions/pull/284

Context
*******

Following the creation of ExternalGraderDetail (ADR 1) and SubmissionFile (ADR 2) models, we need to implement the API
endpoints that will allow external graders (xqueue-watcher) to interact with the system. The current XQueue implementation
provides three critical endpoints that need to be replicated:

1. Authentication Service:
   - Secure login mechanism for external graders
   - Session management
   - CSRF handling for specific endpoints

2. Submission Retrieval (get_submission):
   - Queue-based submission distribution
   - Status tracking and locking mechanism
   - File information packaging for graders

3. Result Processing (put_result):
   - Score validation and processing
   - Status updates
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

The current XQueue implementation has these services spread across multiple systems, requiring complex HTTP communication
and session management. The existing workflow:

1. Authentication Flow:
   - Basic username/password authentication
   - Session-based token management
   - Manual CSRF handling for specific endpoints

2. Submission Processing:
   - Manual queue status checks
   - Complex state transitions
   - Synchronous HTTP-based file retrieval

3. Result Handling:
   - Direct database updates
   - Limited error recovery
   - Complex retry logic

Decision
********

We will implement a unified service approach that brings together all the functionality needed for external grader integration. This approach will:

1. Simplify Authentication:
   - Create a more straightforward login process for external graders
   - Make session handling more reliable
   - Ensure security while reducing technical complexity

2. Improve Submission Handling:
   - Create a more efficient way to distribute submissions to graders
   - Track the status of submissions more reliably
   - Provide all necessary information to graders in a consistent format

3. Enhance Results Processing:
   - Process scores more reliably
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Provide better feedback to both graders and the platform

The solution will be built as a consolidated service that external graders can interact with through standard REST API endpoints. This will make integration easier for external services while providing better monitoring and control for the platform.

Key Benefits:

1. External graders will have a single, consistent interface
2. The platform will have better visibility into the grading process
3. Error handling will be improved across the entire workflow
4. Security will be enhanced through better authentication practices

This approach connects directly with the previously created data models for external graders and submission files, providing a complete end-to-end solution for the grading workflow.

Consequences
************

Positive:
---------

1. Architecture:
   - Consolidated service endpoints
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Improved error handling
   - Better session management

2. Security:
   - Robust authentication
   - Secure file handling
   - Protected state transitions

3. Operations:
   - Simplified deployment
   - Better monitoring capabilities
   - Improved error visibility
   - Automatic retry handling

Negative:
---------

1. Complexity:
   - More complex session management
   - Additional state validation required
   - Complex transaction handling

2. Performance:
   - Additional database operations
   - Session verification overhead

3. Migration:
   - Changes required in external graders
   - New deployment procedures needed
