    This api function:
      1. Creates a `TeamSubmission` record, and
      2. Creates `Submission` records for ONLY those team members that don't have any past submissions

    This means that the ORA `SubmissionMixin` must first collect all of the files of the submitting user
    and the team into the `answer` dict.

    Parameters:
        - course_id (str): the course id for this team submission
        - item_id (str): the item id for this team submission
        - team_id (str): the team_id for the team for which we are making the submission
        - submitting_user_id (User): the user who has hit the "submit" button
        - team_member_ids (list of str): a list of the anonymous user ids associated with all members of the team
        - answer (json serializable object): string, dict, or other json-serializable object that represents the team's
                                             answer to the problem
        - submitted_at (datetime): (optional [default = now]) the datetime at which the team submission was submitted
        - attempt number (int): (optional [default = 1]) the attempt number for this submission
        - item_type (str): (optional [default = 'openassessment']) the type of item for which this submission is being
                                                                   submitted

    Returns:
        dict: A representation of the created TeamSubmission, with the following keys:
          'team_submission_uuid' Is the `uuid` field of the created `TeamSubmission`.
          'course_id' Is the ID of the course.
          'item_id' Is the ID of the item (e.g. the block).
          'team_id' Is the ID of the team.
          'submitted_by' Is the ID of the submitting user (same as `submitting_user_id`)
          'attempt_number' is the attempt number this submission represents for this question.
          'submitted_at' represents the time this submission was submitted, which can be configured, versus the...
          'created_at' date, which is when the submission is first created.
          'submission_uuids' Is a list of the UUIDs of each of the individual `Submission` records that is created.

    Raises:
        TeamSubmissionRequestError: Raised when there are validation errors for the
            student item or team submission. This can be caused by the student item
            missing required values, the submission being too long, the
            attempt_number is negative, or the given submitted_at time is invalid.
        SubmissionRequestError: Raised when there are validation errors for the underlying
            student item or submission. This can be caused by the same reason as
            the TeamSubmissionRequestError
        TeamSubmissionInternalError: Raised when submission access causes an
            internal error.
        TeamSubmissionInternalError: Raised when submission access causes an
            internal error when creating the underlying submissions.

    Examples:
